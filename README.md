## Thank you
Thank you the Odin Project
and to the very helpful providers of internet resources 



NOTE: each card represents a different color, which was 
simple and fast to implement. I admit this makes 
the game too easy and this is not a good choice, however
i think I still achieved the main purpose of the exercise.
